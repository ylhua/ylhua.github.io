excerpt: 'A perception framework combining fixed and mobile cameras is proposed, which can achieve accurate real-time positioning of the mobile camera in a unified coordinate system. The system integrates VGGT for high-precision pose estimation and combines it with MASt3r-SLAM for robust real-time tracking. Alignment between different coordinate systems is achieved through rotation matrix transformation and Procrustes analysis.'
