<h3>VR Training Simulation for Airplane Parking</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Tools:</strong> Unity, Blender, OpenXR, Meta Quest 3<br>
  <strong>Course:</strong> Virtual Reality in Theory and Practice (MAMF45), Lund University
</p>

<p>
  Step into the future of ground crew training with the
  <strong>VR Training Simulation for Airplane Parking</strong>. This immersive simulation is designed to train staff in a realistic, hands-on virtual environment that mirrors the complexity of real-world aircraft docking.
</p>

<p>Key Features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Real-Time Distance Detection:</strong>
    Integrated with an <strong>ABD sensor</strong>, the simulation accurately tracks the distance between the aircraft and the jetbridge. A control panel allows users to start and stop the docking process, ensuring precise alignment every time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Interactive Obstacle Challenge:</strong>
    A <strong>movable suitcase</strong> acts as an unexpected runway obstacle, testing users’ situational awareness and reaction time. Stay alert—keeping the path clear is part of the job.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Immersive, Real-World Environment:</strong>
    Experience a life-sized apron area with realistic physics and visuals. The accurately modeled environment and ABD sensor replicate the conditions of an actual airport runway.
  </li>
</ul>
