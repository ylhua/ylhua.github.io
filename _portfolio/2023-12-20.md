# Interactive Ray Tracing   
**Tools**: OpenGL · GLSL · C++  
**Course**: EDAN35 Computer Graphics, Lund University  

## Project Overview

Ever wondered how *realistic lighting*, *reflections*, and *shadows* are achieved in modern 3D environments?  
Our **Interactive Ray Tracing** project brings those ideas to life by transforming a traditional ray tracing engine into an **interactive experience**.

Inspired by Peter Shirley’s *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* series and enriched with OpenGL-based implementations, we created a **interactive real-time ray tracing application** where users can manipulate the scene and visualize the effects of light and material interactions dynamically.

This isn’t just a renderer — it’s a sandbox for learning how light behaves.

## Key Features

### Real-Time Ray Tracing Engine  
- Ray-sphere and ray-quad intersection detection  
- Lambertian, metal, and dielectric materials  
- Recursive ray tracing with adjustable depth  
- Basic Perlin noise textures and procedural generation  
- Rendering scenes pixel-by-pixel  

### Interactive GUI 
Our custom user interface gives users full control over the rendering process:
- **Preview Mode**: Move the camera with keyboard inputs in a low-sample fast mode  
- **Default Mode**: High-quality rendering with anti-aliasing  
- **Sliders & Toggles** for:
  - Ray depth  
  - Sampling rate  
  - Exposure level  
  - Defocus blur settings  
  - Motion blur switch
