# VR Fire Safety Training Project
**Tools**: Unity, Blender, OpenXR, Meta Quest 3  
**Course**: Universal Design, Theory and Project - TNSF10, Lund University  

## Overview  
An immersive VR experience designed to democratize fire safety training through inclusive design and interactive learning.  

### Key Features  
- **Universal Accessibility**  
  - Adjustable text sizes, sound levels & subtitle positioning  
  - Wheelchair-friendly interactions  
  - Interpretive subtitles for cognitive inclusivity  

- **Realistic Training**  
  - Gesture-controlled fire extinguisher  
  - Environmental cues (alarms, smoke)  
  - Walk-through mode for guided learning  

- **Iterative Design**  
  - User testing prioritized cognitive/physical accessibility  
  - Modular design for future scalability (multiplayer, randomized scenarios)  

## Impact  
Bridges the gap between safety education and diverse user needs—proving VR’s potential for inclusive emergency preparedness.
